Verilog Logic and Arithmetic Operations — Vivado Project

Description

This project implements basic bitwise logic gates and arithmetic operations using Verilog HDL. The following operations are supported:

✅ 4-bit Addition

✅ 4-bit Subtraction

✅ 4-bit Bitwise NOT

✅ 4-bit Bitwise AND

✅ 4-bit Bitwise OR


The design is written in Verilog and simulated using Xilinx Vivado.

 Tools and Technologies Used

Vivado	2020.2 or later	Design entry, simulation
Verilog HDL	IEEE 1364-2005	Hardware description language
Testbench	Custom Testbench	For simulation and verification


▶ Simulation Details

The testbench (tb_basic_operations.v) simulates different input combinations and verifies:

Sum and difference results

Bitwise NOT of both inputs

Bitwise AND and OR between inputs


Simulation output can be observed using Vivado's Behavioral Simulation.



Sample Test Inputs

0 0 and 0 1 and 1 0 and 1 1

How to Use

1. Open Vivado → Create a new RTL project


2. Add basic_operations.v as the design source


3. Add tb_basic_operations.v as the simulation source


4. Run Behavioral Simulation


5. Observe results in the Simulation waveform or Console output
